<p>A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks. Itâ€™s used to write software programs and applications, and to control and manipulate computer systems. There are many different programming languages, each with its own syntax, structure, and set of commands. Some of the most commonly used programming languages include Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, and C#. The choice of programming language depends on the specific requirements of a project, including the platform being used, the intended audience, and the desired outcome. Programming languages continue to evolve and change over time, with new languages being developed and older ones being updated to meet changing needs.</p>
